# CHRONOS ⚙️ FRONTEND 

## Program Algorithm 📊
- Authentication
  - Create or enter account (The frontend displays registration or login forms and collects the data entered by the user. It sends this data to the backend and waits for a success or error response. If the backend confirms a successful login, the frontend stores the token or session and redirects the user to the appropriate section of the site.)
  - Log out (The frontend initiates a logout request. Then, the user is redirected to the main page. This ensures that access to protected pages is no longer possible without logging in again.)
- Calendar
  - Create calendar (The frontend opens a modal form for entering the calendar title and description. The user fills in the fields and clicks the save button, then the data is sent to the backend for validation and calendar creation. After receiving a response from the server, the modal closes, and the calendar list is updated or an error message is displayed.)
  - Share calendar ()
